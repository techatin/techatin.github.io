bios: Something about me that people might be interested in
---

I am currently a highschool student in Singapore (though we call it JC, or Junior College, there).
I am a programmer who loves mathematics and a mathematician(hopefully) who loves programming. This blog
would generally be used to document programming or mathematics related things that I find intriguing,
or experiences related to Informatics Olympiad. But of course, there might be rants or occasional humour(I have a bad sense of humour!) in case I feel like it.


As is with all Singaporean males, I will enlist 2 years later after graduation. Before I lost my freedom, let me just try to make full use of my time, and actually do something legitimate with this blog. Anyway,
enjoy!
