# I Love Marymount JC!!!!!!

This is a school where the principal can casually say 'You guys can suffer. I can sleep soundly at night'. Awesome!!! After all, he is just 'protecting my Alma Mater'.

I mean, come on, when you want to post something, you must THINK:

> 🤔🤔🤔THINK!!!🤔🤔🤔

> is it TRUE???🤔🤔🤔✅

> it it HELPFUL???🙏🙆🙆✅

> is it INSPIRING???👨👨👨👨👨👨‍💼👩👩👩👩👩👩‍💼👩👩👩👩👩👩‍🔬✅

> is it NECESSARY?👌👍💪✅

> is it KIND?❤😄❤✅

> if NOT, THEN DON'T POST IT!!!

> ❌❌❌😡😡😡❌❌❌

And come on, those from Year 1-4, where is your decency?

And you know? You **MUST** follow the school rules!!! Even if it is outside school! Afterall, you are **representing** the school, and as we all know, the almighty man himself wants to protect his Alma Mater!!! You know what does that mean? Even if you are showering, you **MUST** wear your school uniform with **pride**!!! That is what is expected of a **Marymountian**!!!

I think that is enough to remind you what does it mean to be a Marymountian. Let's end it off with a cheer full of spirit and enthusiasm:

    Marymountians unite we will show out might!
    We will show them how Marymountians fight!
    We will walk to the fight in red black white coz ain't nobody's gonna break out stride
    Coz we're for we're for MJC woo, MJC arrh
    We're for we're for MJC Yeah!
